# MicroStore Optimizer (gen_zero)

## One-line Description

A Flutter app that helps small merchants track performance (KPIs), view sales, and act on deterministic, explainable insights (restock, pricing, bundles) with offline-first local persistence.

## The Problem

Small merchants often have product and transaction data, but not the time or tooling to convert it into decisions. They need:

- Clear KPIs that work on a phone.
- Actionable recommendations with a simple rationale ("why this?").
- Offline-first reliability for a fast, predictable MVP.

## The Solution

MicroStore Optimizer provides:

- A KPI dashboard designed to remain stable on small screens and under large accessibility text.
- An insights feed that translates patterns into next actions with `why / impact / action`.
- A demo-mode seeding flow so the app can be shown instantly without setup.

## Core Features

### Dashboard KPIs

- Derived from persisted sales data.

### Insights Engine (MVP)

Every insight is explainable with `why`, `impact`, and `action`.

Insight types:

- Restock alert (high velocity + low stock)
- Price increase or price decrease suggestions (demand vs price position)
- Top performer and underperformer detection
- Bundle opportunity detection (co-occurrence in orders)

### Products

- Create and edit a local product catalog.

### Sales

- View recent orders.
- Generate demo sales for a reliable walkthrough.

### Demo Mode

- Seeds realistic catalog and sales data.
- Tuned to reliably generate a compelling mix of insights.

## Tech Stack

- Flutter (Material 3)
- Dart (`sdk: ^3.8.1`)
- Riverpod (state management)
- Hive (offline-first local persistence)
- go_router (navigation)
- fl_chart (charts)

## Architecture

Clean Architecture-inspired separation:

### Domain

- Entities/value objects such as `Product`, `Sale`, `SaleLine`, and `Insight`.
- Deterministic, composable rule-based `InsightEngine`.

### Data

- Hive persistence with manual adapters.
- Repositories mapping persistence models to domain entities.

### Presentation

- Riverpod controllers/providers.
- UI renders domain output only (no insight logic in UI).

## Implementation Highlights

- Responsive KPI layout:
  - Cards adapt to width and text scale.
  - Content is clipped to rounded shapes to avoid overflow artifacts.
- Reliable demo data generation:
  - Seeding is idempotent and fills missing demo content even if partial data exists.
  - UI shows stable success/error feedback per user action.
