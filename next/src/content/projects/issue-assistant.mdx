# Issue Assistant

Deterministic-first GitHub issue triage engine: maintainers get explicit artifacts they can review, version, and trust.

## Overview

- Role: Owner / Engineer
- Form factors: Python package (PyPI) + CLI + GitHub Action
- Focus: deterministic automation, maintainer workflow support, artifact-first outputs

Issue Assistant is built to produce consistent triage outputs for issues without probabilistic phrasing. It runs locally as a CLI and in GitHub Actions for issue events and scheduled digests.

## Problem

Issue triage is expensive and repetitive.

- Maintainers need a stable issue summary.
- Maintainership load needs to be visible (what is piling up, why).
- Automation must be reviewable and deterministic to avoid increasing trust and review burden.

## Constraints

- Determinism: the same inputs must produce the same outputs.
- Inspectability: every decision must be grounded in explicit rules and evidence fields.
- Maintainer-first artifacts: outputs must be readable and versionable.
- GitHub-native: must integrate with issue events and scheduled workflows.
- Safe defaults: no speculative language, no invented facts.

## Solution

Issue Assistant implements a phased analysis pipeline and emits artifacts intended for maintainers.

Typical outputs include:

- `ISSUE_SUMMARY.md`
- `MAINTAINER_LOAD.md`
- `EXPLAINABILITY.md` (rules, thresholds, and evidence fields)

It can run in two primary modes:

1) As a Python package / CLI (`issue-assistant` → `issue_assistant.cli:main`)
2) As a GitHub Action (issue events + weekly digest)

## Key Decisions

### 1) Deterministic-first rules

Issue Assistant uses explicit rule evaluation with declared thresholds and evidence fields. It avoids probabilistic language and does not fabricate missing context.

### 2) Artifact outputs over ephemeral suggestions

The system emits versionable outputs (Markdown + JSON) so maintainers can:

- review diffs
- link artifacts in PRs
- keep a stable historical record

### 3) Two distribution surfaces

- Python package under `src/issue_assistant/*` for local use and CI scripting
- A GitHub Action (composite action) that installs from PyPI and runs analysis

### 4) Phased pipeline with tests per phase

Phases are independently testable (`tests/test_phase*.py`) to keep changes reviewable and to prevent regressions.

## Operability

- Clear failure behavior: missing context reduces output detail rather than generating invented claims.
- Designed for GitHub API constraints: rate limiting and partial metadata availability are treated as expected conditions.
- Workflow-friendly: outputs can be attached to PRs, stored as artifacts, or committed based on project policy.

## Results

- Lower maintainer load through consistent summaries and routing cues.
- Better trust: decisions are explicit and anchored to evidence fields.
- Reviewable automation: changes to rules and outputs become normal diffs.
