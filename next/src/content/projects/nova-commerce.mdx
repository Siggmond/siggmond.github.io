# NovaCommerce - Flutter E-commerce App (Firebase + AI)

## Short Portfolio Description

Built a production-style e-commerce mobile app with Flutter, Riverpod, and Firebase.
Implemented full shopping flows (browse, search, product variants, cart, checkout, and orders), plus wishlist, offers, loyalty, payments, and AI-assisted UX.

## Key Highlights

- Feature-first clean architecture (presentation/domain/data) with Riverpod state management.
- Advanced routing with go_router, tabbed shell navigation, and nested routes.
- Firestore transactional checkout that validates and decrements variant stock atomically before creating orders.
- Local-first persistence (cart, wishlist, recent searches/viewed) with sync when signed in.
- Payment flow architecture with Stripe (Cloud Functions + Payment Sheet), PayPal/demo, and fake providers.
- On-device TFLite intent model for smart navigation suggestions.
- Quality pipeline: CI runs format, analyze, tests (including golden tests), and release APK build.
- 25 automated tests across viewmodels, widgets, routing behavior, mapping, and AI logic.
