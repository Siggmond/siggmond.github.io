# RepoScope AI

Deterministic repository intelligence: artifact-first documentation for fast, trustable onboarding.

## Overview

- Role: Owner / Engineer
- Focus: DevTools, onboarding velocity, inspectability

RepoScope AI is built to answer a simple question quickly and reliably: **"What is this repo, how does it work, and where do I start?"**

Instead of relying on a black-box summary, the system is designed around **inspectable artifacts** (index files, structured summaries, references) that make the output verifiable and maintainable.

## Problem

Large repositories are expensive to understand.

- New engineers spend days building a mental model.
- Documentation is often outdated or unstructured.
- Search is noisy and lacks context.
- AI summaries can be fast but are hard to trust without evidence.

## Constraints

- **Trust**: output must be verifiable (not vibes).
- **Determinism**: results should be stable enough to review and version.
- **Speed**: first useful artifacts must be produced quickly.
- **Scale**: should work on real repos with many files.
- **Bounded scope**: solve onboarding and navigation first; avoid becoming a full platform.

## Solution

RepoScope AI produces an artifact set that acts as a repository "map":

- A top-level index of key areas
- Structured summaries per module/area
- References back to source paths
- A predictable entry point for onboarding

The goal is a tight feedback loop:

"Generate artifacts" → "Review" → "Commit" → "Use for onboarding".

## Key decisions

### 1) Artifact-first over chat-first
Artifacts can be reviewed, diffed, and improved. This makes the system compatible with real engineering workflows.

### 2) Explicit boundaries and scope
The system focuses on onboarding and navigation. It avoids being a general-purpose agent or an always-on service.

### 3) Inspectability as a hard requirement
Every summary is expected to be anchored to a path and backed by evidence.

### 4) Deterministic outputs where possible
Stable structure enables:

- PR review of documentation changes
- incremental improvements
- consistent onboarding quality

## Operability

- Clear failure modes: if an artifact can’t be produced, the output should degrade gracefully.
- Output is designed to be human-reviewable.
- Incremental iteration is preferred over one-shot generation.

## Results

- Faster onboarding path: a clear starting point and repository map
- Better trust: artifacts can be reviewed and versioned
- Better maintenance: improvements become normal PRs instead of tribal knowledge
