# TaskFlow Pro

## Overview

A portable, frontend-only project management app that exercises production-style frontend architecture patterns (typed API boundary, feature modules, global error handling, RBAC) without requiring a real backend to run.

## Stack

Vue 3 · TypeScript · Vite · Pinia · Vue Router · Axios

## Why

Build a portable, frontend-only project management app that exercises production-style frontend architecture patterns (typed API boundary, feature modules, global error handling, RBAC) without requiring a real backend to run.

## Problem

Teams need a lightweight way to organize work into projects and track tasks moving through a workflow, while still modeling real product constraints like authenticated access, role-based permissions, and an audit trail of changes.

## Tradeoffs

A localStorage-backed mock backend preserves realistic HTTP semantics but cannot model true concurrency or server-enforced invariants; it optimizes for portability and architectural clarity.

## Excludes

Intentionally excludes a real backend, multi-user concurrency, and long-term data governance concerns.

## Failure modes

- localStorage quota / corruption
- 401/403 auth failures and role gating errors
- Retryable request failures surfaced through normalized errors
- Optimistic UI updates requiring rollback
- State hydration mismatches on refresh

## Architecture

```
Single-page Vue 3 + TypeScript application built with Vite.
Routing via Vue Router with auth guards and role-gated routes.
State via Pinia stores per feature module with a strict store/service split.
Centralized Axios client with retry, normalized errors, and 401 handling.
Mock REST API implemented as an Axios adapter backed by localStorage.
Auth simulated via bearer token encoding userId.
Global toast store for runtime/store errors; theme persisted in localStorage.
```

## Key decisions

- Feature-first module layout (src/modules/*) to keep domain boundaries clear.
- Strict store/service split so side effects live behind a typed boundary.
- Centralized Axios client for consistent retries and error normalization.
- RBAC enforced in both UI and store layers to prevent accidental privilege escalation.
- Mock REST API implemented as an Axios adapter to preserve real HTTP semantics.
- localStorage-backed persistence to enable realistic CRUD flows without server infra.
- Optimistic task movement with rollback on failure for correct UX modeling.
- Activity log modeled as explicit domain events emitted by the mock API.

## Differentiators

- Persistent mock backend supporting auth, RBAC, and CRUD without a real server.
- Authoritative permission checks in the state layer, not just UI gating.
- Resilient failure behavior with retries, normalized errors, and global surfacing.
- Typed domain contracts and a consistent REST-like API surface.
- Audit-style activity feed tied to domain mutations.
